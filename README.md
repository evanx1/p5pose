# Posenet Studio Deliverable Project 1: Evan Xie

# P5 ML PoseNet Start Kit

This repository uses [p5.js](https://p5js.org), [ml5.js](https://ml5js.org), and [PoseNet] to display a webcam image, labelled with pose detection skeleton and points.

## Installation

1. Clone this repo.

2. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org). 
   - On macOS, [install HomeBrew](https://brew.sh), and then enter `brew install node` into a terminal window.
   - On Windows, install it from the [Node.js download page](https://nodejs.org/en/).

3. In a terminal window:
   - Change directories (`cd`) into the repository directory.
   - Enter `npm install`

## Running

In a terminal window:

- Change directories (`cd`) into the repository directory.
- Enter `npm start`

This will open PoseNet in a browser window.

## Description
 The purpose of my project was to create a space in which user could move about a screen (Posenet) based on how a given set of musical tracks made them feel. The idea was to use the ellipse trackers from Posenet to give the user a better sense of how they are moving and specifically, why they choose to move certain ways when hearing different music. With 3 given clickfunction buttons, the user is presented with "calm," "sad," and "up 2 u" options that are all clickable on the screen. When clicking on any of these individual tracks, the user will hear music based on that track's title. From this point, the user is free to move about the screen based on how they feel. 

 ## Instructions 
 First, open "terminal" in the computer's serach bar. Next, type in the terminal "cd p5pose" . Next, type in the terminal, "npm install" . After the program is fnished installing, it will say so in the terminal. From here, type "npm start" and the terminal will automatically launch Posenet. From this point, the user will see 3 buttons at the bottom lefthand side of the screen titled "calm" "sad" and "up 2 u" . As these buttons are clearly depicted as clickable buttons, the user has the open-ended option to click each one, at whatever order they desire, to then hear originally composed musical tracks associated with that button's title. The user is then left with the option to move about the screen (as instructed during the presentation) according to what they think the "accurate" movements are for that sound. 

 (After attempting to give each button an associated background color to match that sound, I unfortunately was unable to get that part of the code to work properly. However, as noticed when clicking each button, a brief flash of the associated color comes up for a split second on screen.)

 I could not figure out how to get the screenshot into 'Readme' so it is in the p5pose folder.
